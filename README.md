## Abstract

This paper proposes a scene structuring algorithm designed to enhance the temporal and emotional coherence of fictional narratives, particularly for interpretation by Large Language Models (LLMs). The method employs structured segment codes (SCN, BIO, HIS) and behavioral/emotional tags to enable consistent multi-perspective storytelling.
